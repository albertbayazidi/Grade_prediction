# Grade_prediction

## Overview  
This is a notebook using Linear regression to predict the finle math grade of Secondary School Students


## Usage
The code is writen so that you can use any combination of integer features/input provided by the dataset.  
The accuracy will change depending on the input. The code has two test examples, one with 72.5% accuracy and one with 70.8% accuracy.  


## Functionality  
This code was mainly built using the PyTorch framework howevery not for the linear regression but so that I could have a custom dataloader.  
The linear regression was provided by the sklearn python package with some help from numpy.
